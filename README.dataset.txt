This infrared drones project contains thermal images of drones, cars, and people. It can be used for detecting UAVs at night and in low-light conditions. Several types of quadcopters and multi-rotor craft are represented in the dataset. 150 images and a pre-trained model are included.

Some example use-cases for this computer vision project include:

* Detecting expionage and spying activities
* Protecting VIPs from drone attacks
* Keeping track of your drone while flying at night
* Creating a live heads up display for a drone race
* Enforcing rules restricting drone usage

This project could also be combined with images from other [drone detection datasets](https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=flying%20drone) to create an even better model.
